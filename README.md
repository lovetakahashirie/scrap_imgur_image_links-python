# scrap_imgur_image_links-python

## What does this repo do?
U input an url link with multiple pics, then u can get a .txt file, containing all the .jpeg image links on that page


Different from the old one, u cant generate multiple links at a time, so this py is here to solve the problem

input the url link, and choose the name of the txt file in the last cell (PS: 'string'), then run the program

so the txt file will be automatically saved

sth like this
